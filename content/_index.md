One day, for what ever reason, you decide that your not really happy with your work. It doesn't matter if your job is x or y, but you think that you might want to get into that sweet sweet IT sector. Well, this very opinionated document might be just what you need!

This document will go over what I think might be a path into becoming an IT guy. Now, we in it like to throw the term engineer around a lot, but this is not a guid to get a degree of any kind. For this guide you only need to be able to know how to read, and handle a mouse and a keyboard. If you made it this far, I guess reading is not a problem. It would help if you are naturally curious about how things work, as that will help drive you towards finding solutions to your problems, but you can get very far by just reading documentation and trying things out.

## prerequisites

On that note, I do assume you have a computer that you can install software on. You need to be able to try thing out and tinker with them to see how it works. I will not tell you what operating system to run, but we all know that any form of Linux is the best. For brevity's sake I will not tell you how to install the tools we need, but I will link you to the tool's documentation. Take that as a lesson, as reading documentation is an importand part of what I'm teaching here.

One more important note, the IT landscape is always changing. I will try to point you towards skills and information that will be use full long time, but it can be that certain software or tools are not in favor any more when you read this. If that happens, use your curiosity to find a tool that fits the same place.
