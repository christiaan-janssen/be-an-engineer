There are a lot of different Operating Systems floating around on the internet. And there are a lot of holy wars fought over what is the best OS around. I am a strong believer in *use the right tool for the job* and this makes it so that, while I have a preference, I can do most of my work on whatever you put infront of me. Sure I will struggle for a bit if it is something I'm not used to (Like BSD), but with some effort I can do my job. This leads into an importand point, **learn the tools, not the OS**.

Now, having said that, most of the internet runs on a form of Linux. Sure, Microsoft has found a way to wiggle Active Directory into Azure, but most of the web and the cloud run on Linux. Therefore I will spend most of this document using that and the tools it gives us. I sugest you learn to use it as well. It is not difficult in any way, and I will give some guidance on installing it in to a Virtual Machine.

## Windows

Windows, the OS we all love to hate, especially if you like open-source. We all know Microsoft is the big bad Corp, but if you are really honest, Windows did bring computers to the masses. Sure it has its flaws, but you can do maybe 90% of your work on a windows machine. Especially WSL has brought a lot of the tools we need, and most big tools work on Windows.

Now, having said that, I personally prefer Linux. It gives me more control over what I'm doing and since most of the servers / containers I work with are Linux any way, it just makes sense.

## Linux

Linux was created by [Linus Torvalds](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds). Or, to be more precise, Linus created the Linux Kernel. The Kernel is the core os a Linux Operating System. The Kernel interacts with the computer hardware like the CPU, Memory or external devices like mouse, keyboard or printers.

At the moment of writing, Linux is mostly used in the server space. Most web servers run a flavor of Linux and a lot of advancements like micro services are build on top of Linux

## OSX

Apple OSX is [based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS) on Unix. It is currently the second most used desktop after Windows and before Linux.
