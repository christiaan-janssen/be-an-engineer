There are a lot of different Operating Systems floating around on the internet. And there are a lot of holy wars fought over what is the best OS around. I am a strong beliver in *use the right tool for the job* and this makes it so that, while I have a preference, I can do most of my work on whatever you put infront of me. Sure I will struggle for a bit if it is something I'm not used to (Like BSD), but with some effort I can do my job. This leads into an importand point, **learn the tools, not the OS**. 

Now, having said that, most of the internet runs on a form of Linux. Sure, Microsoft has found a way to wiggle Active Directory into Azure, but most of the web and the cloud run on Linux. Therefore I will spend most of this document using that and the tools it gives us. I sugest you learn to use it as well. It is not difficult in any way, and I will give some guidance on installing it in to a Virtual Machine.
## Windows
## Linux
## OSX
