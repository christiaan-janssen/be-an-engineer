# Be an Engineer

A good friend of mine wants to get back into the dev/ops/sre/whatever world. I wanted to help him with some guidance to get him back up to speed. While is started writing some documentation I realized it could help more people. There for I decided to make it into a web document that can be found [here](https://christiaan-janssen.github.io/be-an-engineer/)
